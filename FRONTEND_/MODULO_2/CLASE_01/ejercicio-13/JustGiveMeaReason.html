    <span>PINK</span> - 
    <span>  The Truth About Love</span> - 
    <span>2013</span>

    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Right from the start</p>
    <p>You were a thief, you stole my heart</p>
    <p>And I, your willing victim</p>
    <p>I let you see the parts of me</p>
    <p>That weren't all that pretty</p>
    <p>And with every touch you fixed them</p>
    <p>Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh</p>
    <p>Things you never say to me, oh, oh</p>
    <p>Tell me that you've had enough</p>
    <p>Of our love, our love</p>
    <p>Just give me a reason</p>
    <p>Just a little bit's enough</p>
    <p>Just a second, we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>It's in the stars</p>
    <p>It's been written in the scars on our hearts</p>
    <p>We're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>I'm sorry I don't understand</p>
    <p>Where all of this is coming from</p>
    <p>I thought that we were fine</p>
    <p>(Oh, we had everything)</p>
    <p>Your head is running wild again</p>
    <p>My dear we still have everything</p>
    <p>And it's all in your mind</p>
    <p>(Yeah, but this is happening)</p>
    <p>Now you've been having real bad dreams, oh, oh</p>
    <p>You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh</p>
    <p>There's nothing more than empty sheets</p>
    <p>Between our love, our love</p>
    <p>Oh, our love, our love</p>
    <p>Just give me a reason</p>
    <p>Just a little bit's enough</p>
    <p>Just a second, we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>I've never stopped</p>
    <p>You're still written in the scars on my heart</p>
    <p>You're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>Oh, tears ducts and rust</p>
    <p>I'll fix it for us</p>
    <p>We're collecting dust</p>
    <p>But our love's enough</p>
    <p>You're holding it in</p>
    <p>You're pouring a drink</p>
    <p>No, nothing is as bad as it seems</p>
    <p>We'll come clean</p>
    <p>Just give me a reason</p>
    <p>Just a little bit's enough</p>
    <p>Just a second, we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>It's in the stars</p>
    <p>It's been written in the scars on our hearts</p>
    <p>That we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>Just give me a reason</p>
    <p>Just a little bit's enough</p>
    <p>Just a second, we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>It's in the stars</p>
    <p>It's been written in the scars on our hearts</p>
    <p>That we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>Oh-oh, we can learn to love again</p>
    <p>Oh-oh, can learn to love again</p>
    <p>Oh-oh, that we're not broken, just bent</p>
    <p>And we can learn to love again</p>
